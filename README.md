# Source Map Visualization

Demo: [https://evanw.github.io/source-map-visualization/](http://evanw.github.io/source-map-visualization/)

This is a visualization of JavaScript/CSS source map data, which is useful for debugging problems with generated source maps. It's designed to be high-performance so it doesn't fall over with huge source maps.
